# Finmer Modules

A collection of various modules I've created for [Finmer](https://get.finmer.dev).
Each module is in its own folder.

> [!WARNING]
> From [Finmer](https://github.com/pileofwolves/finmer)'s README (edited slightly): Finmer contains adult fiction and fantasy content. Proceed at your own risk. If you stumbled across this project by accident, chances are you're not interested in the subject matter and should move on. :)

## Licensing

All of the modules -- unless otherwise stated -- are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0).
This is the same license that Finmer's Core module uses.

Some modules may contain libraries under other licenses.
The libraries included, along with their licenses, will be detailed by the respective module's README.
The files containing the libraries may also include some code belonging to the module. (They cannot be separate files, due to limitations of Finmer's engine.)
That code is under the same license as the rest of the module.
(The code that belongs to the module and not the library will be visibly marked, and will always be at the bottom of the file.)
